# GraphDataStructures_Java

This repository contains Java files that I have prepared as a submission to the Advanced Data structures in Java course.
The purpose of this task was to write methods that will be used to represent graphs and find shortest path between vertices using different algorithms.
Some of the methods in MapGraph file were already there, provided by the teacher.
